# and shutil are built into Python and don't need to be installed separately.

# Installation instructions:
# 1. Install PyTorch first (choose appropriate version for your system):
#    For CPU: pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
#    For CUDA: pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
#
# 2. Install other requirements:
#    pip install -r requirements_advanced.txt
#
# 3. For face recognition, you may need additional system dependencies:
#    Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx libglib2.0-0
#    macOS: No additional dependencies needed
#    Windows: Visual C++ Redistributable may be required

# Install other requirements
pip install -r requirements_advanced.txt
```

### 2. System Dependencies
For face recognition, you may need:
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx libglib2.0-0`

4. Use "📊 View Analysis" for detailed reports

### 2. Face Matching Across Videos
1. Process first video normally
2. Click "👥 Match Faces" to see face matching results
3. Process second video - faces will be automatically matched
4. Use "📋 Attendance Report" to see cross-video attendance

### 3. Lecture Classification
1. Select video for analysis
2. Click "🎓 Classify Lecture" 
3. View classification results with confidence scores
4. See detailed reasoning for classification

### 4. Advanced Analysis Viewer
1. After analysis, click "📊 View Analysis"
2. Navigate through tabs:
   - **Overview**: Key metrics and charts
   - **Students**: Individual student analysis with face images
   - **Face Gallery**: All detected faces with quality scores
   - **Statistics**: Comprehensive charts and graphs
   - **Timeline**: Activity progression over time

## 📊 Database Schema

The system now uses SQLite database with these tables:

- **videos**: Video metadata and file information
- **analysis_sessions**: Analysis runs with parameters and results
- **students**: Student tracking across sessions
- **faces**: Face detection results with images and quality scores
- **attendance_records**: Attendance tracking per session
- **lecture_classifications**: Lecture type classification results
- **face_matching_records**: Face matching across videos

## 🎨 GUI Enhancements

### New Buttons Added:
- **📊 View Analysis**: Opens advanced analysis viewer
- **👥 Match Faces**: Processes face matching for current video
- **🎓 Classify Lecture**: Classifies lecture type
- **📋 Attendance Report**: Shows comprehensive attendance statistics

### Enhanced Features:
- **Automatic database integration** - all analysis results stored
- **Cross-video tracking** - recognizes students across multiple videos
- **Progress tracking** - shows detailed progress for all operations
- **Error handling** - comprehensive error reporting and recovery

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Face Matching Algorithm:
1. **Face Detection**: Uses YOLO face detection model
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts 128-dimensional face encodings
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Euclidean distance between encodings
4. **Threshold Matching**: Configurable similarity threshold (default: 0.6)
5. **Database Storage**: Persistent storage of face encodings and images

### Lecture Classification:
1. **Video Feature Extraction**: Movement, interaction, presentation elements
2. **LLM Classification**: Uses local transformer model (Gemma/DialoGPT)
3. **Rule-based Fallback**: Statistical analysis when LLM unavailable
4. **Confidence Scoring**: 0-1 confidence with detailed reasoning

### Data Management:
1. **Automatic Registration**: Videos and sessions automatically registered
2. **Incremental Updates**: Only new/changed data is processed
3. **Backup/Restore**: Full data backup and restore capabilities
4. **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old data (configurable)

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations:
- **Face encoding caching** to avoid re-computation
- **Batch processing** for multiple videos
- **Lazy loading** of large datasets
- **Database indexing** for fast queries

### Resource Usage:
- **Memory**: ~2-4GB for typical classroom videos
- **Storage**: ~100MB per video analysis (including face images)
- **CPU**: Multi-threaded processing where possible
- **GPU**: Optional for faster LLM inference

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Face Recognition Errors**:
   - Ensure system dependencies are installed
   - Check face detection model files are present
   - Verify image quality in video

2. **LLM Classification Fails**:
   - Install transformers and torch
   - Check available memory (4GB+ recommended)
   - Falls back to rule-based classification automatically

3. **Database Errors**:
   - Check write permissions in application directory
   - Verify SQLite is working (built into Python)
   - Try deleting `classroom_analyzer.db` to reset

4. **Memory Issues**:
   - Use headless mode for large videos
   - Process videos in smaller batches
   - Close other applications

### Debug Mode:
Enable detailed logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
export CLASSROOM_ANALYZER_DEBUG=1
python classroom_analyzer_gui.py
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
- **Real-time face matching** during analysis
- **Advanced behavior analytics** with machine learning
- **Export to external systems** (LMS integration)
- **Multi-language support** for international users
- **Cloud deployment** options
- **Mobile app** companion

### API Development:
- REST API for integration with other systems
- Web interface for remote access
- Batch processing API for server deployment
